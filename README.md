# free-serwer
Scripts for free serwer based on Ubuntu Mate 22.04 LTS

Make directory `/root/install` - there copy all files.


Run 3 scripts:

- `ltsp_00_install`
- `ltsp_01_install`
- `ltsp_02_install`

Check the directories and files. Beware of strange dhcpd and switches...

That is almost all. Reboot serwer and enjoy!

The script `ltsp_03_postinstall` is just for creating some report...
